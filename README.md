# Interactive Sales and Inventory Analytics Dashboard: Business Performance Insights

A dynamic, interactive dashboard built to explore the sales and inventory data of a craft business. This project is an end-to-end Sales and Inventory Analytics Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI. The project was developed completely from scratch, including data collection, data preparation, data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design.
The dashboard provides interactive insights into sales performance, profit trends, order analysis, and inventory status, helping in better business decision-making.

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

•  MS Excel - Used for data collection, creating, cleaning, and structuring the dataset before importing into Power BI for analysis and visualization.

•  Power BI Desktop – Used as the main data visualization platform used for report creation.

•  Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.

•  DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

•  Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (sales, order, inventory) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.

•  File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

## Source: 

The dataset is self-created dataset for learning data collection and extraction from scratch for real world experience. The dataset was collected over six months from a craft shop owner to analyze sales and inventory performance.

The dataset contains structured business data including:

• Order details

• Product information

• Customer data

• Sales and profit values

• Inventory stock levels


## Business Problem:

The business that I approached needed a clear and interactive way to monitor their sales performance and inventory status. However, raw data in spreadsheets makes it difficult to quickly answer important questions such as:

• How is the business performing this month compared to last month?

• Which products generate the most profit?

• Are there any low-stock products that need attention?

• What are the overall sales trends over time?

Without a proper dashboard, decision-making becomes slow and inefficient.
